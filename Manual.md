# For now ... #

In the current release, only a basic implementation of the JDBC Annotations has been implemented.

Until I get around to documentation, the best way of learning the features are:
  * Read the cookbook on the front page: http://resurged.org
  * Read the article at: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/os-dw-os-ad-jdbc.html
  * Search for JDBC Annotations on google
  * Read chapter 19 of the proposed final draft, available at http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=221
  * Download the latest release and look at the JUnit tests at: http://code.google.com/p/resurged/source/browse/#hg/src/test/java/org/resurged/test
