The basic functionality are now in place.

Resurged is fully usable, as long as you remember it's in a beta stage.

The main things currently missing are:
  1. Implementing the fancy `DataSet's`, which should be able to synchronize changes in the pojo objects, back to the database.
  1. Documentation

_`*` Resurged will never be able to achive 100% compliance, click [here](http://code.google.com/p/resurged/wiki/SpecCompliance) for the full list of deviations from the original spec._

**Planned features which are not part of the spec:**
  * Returning single values without creating a wrapper class
  * Returning single rows as instances of the wrapper class, instead of instances of List<Wrapper class>, containing a single row
  * Automatic conversion between underscore notation and camel case
  * Support for batch updates
  * Use java.util.Properties for configuration
